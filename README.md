## ü©∏ Blood Donation & Hospital Resource Management System ü©∏

A comprehensive management system built to optimize the entire **blood donation lifecycle**, from **aggregating and managing donor data** to **coordinating and processing blood resources** within hospitals. The core objective is to establish a transparent and **rapid online communication channel**, allowing donors to interact directly with hospitals, minimizing travel time, and ensuring hospitals have a real-time updated blood inventory.

    * Automated scheduling reminders for periodic donations, adhering to medical guidelines.
* **Hospital Blood Inventory Management:**
    * Hospitals can log, withdraw, and track blood stock by blood type and expiration date.
    * Automatic **Threshold Alerts** when the stock of a specific blood type falls below a safe level.
* **Direct & Rapid Interaction:**
    * **Online Blood Requests:** Hospitals can post urgent blood needs and instantly search for compatible donors within the system.
